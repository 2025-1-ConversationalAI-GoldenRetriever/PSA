Jumping from a window to her death in 1889, Eleanor's soul is at unrest until the truth is told about her life and death. She finally finds Leslie, one hundred years later. Leslie bears an uncanny resemblance to Eleanor and is sympathetic if only because of the ghost she carries around herself...In a moment of temporary insanity, Leslie shoots and kills the suspected perpetrator of a hideous child murder. When evidence is inconclusive, Leslie enters a severe depression and is temporarily institutionalized. When she is released from the hospital, her husband, in an effort to change their environment, takes his family to a small New England town to work on a mysterious restoration project of Five Mile House. It doesn't take long for them to hear about Eleanor, a 19th century madwoman who murdered her seven children in Five Mile House. Leslie becomes obsessed with Eleanor's story, suspecting that the truth may be different from the accepted myth. Wellington, locally known for its coven of wiccan followers, has many secrets of its own.The stories of both women are told in parallel narratives until they converge at the very end. As frightening as it is suspenseful,", "Five Mile House", "is a classic page-turner, a haunted house story and also the story about the lengths a mother will go to in order to protect her children."], "description": ["Amazon.com Review", "Karen Novak's remarkably polished first novel is a story of two women separated by a century and linked by the suspicion of madness and the lingering traces of guilt. In 1889, Eleanor Bly murdered her six children and flung herself from the tower of Five Mile House. More than a hundred years later, her ghost, who narrates much of the novel, reaches out to Leslie Stone, a New York cop who has killed a child murderer and is haunted by her action. The house is their common ground. When Leslie's husband comes to Wellington to restore the house for a deep-pocketed local historical organization bent on marketing the town's local witch lore to the vacationing masses, Eleanor finds an audience and Leslie finds... what? \"Her fascination with the house was indeed connected to something else, and if she stared at Five Mile House long enough the image before her would rearrange itself into the form of what she really sought.\"", "Eleanor and Leslie (whose physical resemblance to the 19th-century Medea is uncanny) are, of course, on mirroring quests for redemption, a prize which, the madwoman's ghost realizes, carries a heavy price: \"I do not crave the truth; I dread it.... Yet, without the opportunity to tell my story, all that is left me is the ephemeral, disjointed speculations of others. It is for this reason I protect Five Mile House, to hold my story safe. I protect it from the living who climb the hill to see the relic of a mad woman and pay no heed to the implications of madness in the house itself.\"", "The trope of the madwoman in the attic has a long and distinguished literary history (think", "Jane Eyre", "), and contains a complex tangle of repressed sexual power, threatening desire, and narrative control. Novak uses the metaphor as a springboard into an exploration of history and memory--and into a rollickingly good story, complete with a search for an ancient godhead text, battling covens, and herb-induced suicide. Skillfully interweaving its 19th- and 20th-century tales, accelerating toward a simultaneous revelation of treachery and murder, Novak's ghost story is astonishingly well-balanced, elegant, and spooky. The author's deft touch imbues the novel with a dark gothicism that never veers toward the eye-rolling, shoulder-shrugging absurd. Her first effort should win Novak a legion of fans.", "--Kelly Flynn", "From Publishers Weekly", "In this strong debut, Novak combines suspense with modern witchcraft. Police detective Leslie Stone, a child abuse specialist, shoots an assumed perpetrator; after recuperation in a mental hospital, she leaves the police force. Then her carpenter husband, Greg, accepts an important restoration job at historic Five Mile House in the seemingly idyllic village of Wellington, whose main employer, a concrete recycling plant, is run by Wiccans who are searching for an ancient magical text. So is Harry Wellington, the owner of Five Mile House. As a curious Leslie researches the history of Wellington, Five Mile House and the deaths of the last family who inhabited itAthe mother, Eleanor Bly, supposedly murdered seven of her children and committed suicideAshe realizes she looks exactly like Eleanor. Is it coincidence or the reason the Stones were lured to Wellington? Leslie begins an edgy affair with local lawyer Phillip Hogarth and is befriended by enigmatic herbalist Gwen Garrett. Meanwhile, the ghosts of Eleanor and Amy, whose murder ended Leslie's police career, hover. Eleanor's ghost narrates part of the story, with some disconcerting shifts in tense. By the conclusion, Novak has the reader on tenterhooks as Leslie finds herself in mortal danger. Although this is more a damsel-in-distress novel with a supernatural bent than a traditional mystery, Novak successfully weaves the components together and leaves an opening for a sequel.

One morning, Leslie goes to work on a particularly brutal child homicide. A perpetrator is in custody, and when Leslie goes to interview him, she snaps and metes out a form of vigilante justice that is final and irrevocable.

Will she find the letters and what secrets is she trying to keep?<br /><br />Miss Austen had an interesting make-up.  It was set in Cassandra\u2019s older years and we get to know several of the next generation of the Fowles and Austen family.  Cassandra would read Jane\u2019s letters or her own and then there would be a flash back to that moment in time.  It was an interesting way to get to know everyone and I felt like this novel fleshed out Cassandra\u2019s psyche.  It is very much Cassandra\u2019s novel with Jane as an elusive character.  It did give a great explanation for the years that Jane was not writing.<br /><br />It took until the end of the novel to learn why the letters had to be destroyed as there were no major revelations.  It was letters that told of \u201cJane\u2019s distress and Cassy\u2019s dismay.\u201d Cassandra seemed overly protective of Jane and wanted to ensure the future did not see that she like to pick on the characteristics of people just as she does in her novels.  I don\u2019t think I realized before this novel that there was a third Lloyd sister.  Mary was married to the oldest Austen son, James, and Martha was their loyal friend and future wife of Frank.  I didn\u2019t realize there was a third sister, Elizabeth, that was married to Tom Fowles\u2019s older brother.  This older brother, Fulwar Craven, was the Vicar of Kintbury.  At his death, Cassandra has arrived at his home to look through letters that were sent to his wife Elizabeth.  The connections were very interesting to me and I was glad there was a description of them at the start of the novel.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes:<br />\u201cFor whoever looked at an elderly lady and saw the young heroine she once was?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cCassandra was the executor of her sister\u2019s estate:  the keeper of her flame; the protector of her legacy.  In the time that was left to her, she was determined to find and destroy any evidence that might compromise Jane\u2019s reputation.  It was simply imperative that those letters did not fall into the wrong hands.\u201d<br /><br />Overall, this is a slow gentle tale that finally gives us Cassandra\u2019s story and interesting thoughts to ponder on Jane herself.<br /><br />Book Source:  Kewaunee Public Library.

In Spring of 1840, Cassandra arrives in Kintbury with a mission that she has secretly undertaken to protect the legacy of a beloved sister. This involves searching for letters that have been long forgotten in the vicarage of the Fowle family, letters once written by Jane. In this desperate search, Cassandra encounters a past that is long gone and memories of her youth that come back to haunt her. This story is told not only in prose but in epistolary form as well, including letters and flashbacks from previous decades such as the 1790s, 1800s, and 1810s.<br /><br />What ultimately made me pick this book up was the fact that it was about Cassandra Austen, who I have always found to be an interesting figure. For those of us who love Jane Austen, Cassandra has always seemed like a distant figure in the background of her sister\u2019s life. So, a book with her as the protagonist was a fascinating concept to me.<br /><br />The overall tone of the novel was elegiac and thoughtful. In some ways, this story felt like a love letter to the Austen sisters. Ms Hornby\u2019s prose was gorgeous and this was my favourite aspect of the book. There were points where her writing was poetic and lyrical, almost taking my breath away. Similarly, the dialogue was well-written and seemed accurate for the Regency era. I liked how the author illustrated the scenes and described the world around the characters. It felt like the world of early nineteenth-century England came to life.<br /><br />The pacing of the story was slow and it seemed like there was no discernible plot. This was a huge drawback that resulted in a somewhat tiresome reading experience. There were a couple times where I almost put the book down but I was interested enough to read to the end. If the story moved at a steadier pace and had a more interesting plot, I would have rated this novel more highly.<br /><br />The overall characterisation was good. Ms Hornby depicted her characters in a way that made them come across as human and believable. There were a couple characters (such as Cassandra) who I developed a connection with but found the rest of them to be dull. Another thing I struggled with was the narrative constantly moving back and forth between different time periods. This may just be my own bias as a reader. I found it disorienting and had a difficult time staying interested.<br /><br />One final aspect I would like to discuss is the research. It is obvious in the writing and knowledge contained in the novel that Ms Hornby must have done considerable research. This is something that added a lot to the story.<br /><br />I wanted so much to like this story, especially since it was about Cassandra and Jane Austen.

Kudos to Sandford for taking what could have been an ancient-mystery thriller \u00e0 la Dan Brown (all the ingredients are here, including a secret that could shake the very foundations of Christianity) and playing it like a cop novel. Fans of the Flowers and Davenport series will thoroughly enjoy this one. --David Pitt", "--This text refers to an alternate", "kindle_edition", "edition.", "Excerpt. \u00a9 Reprinted by permission.

Nobody thought that was strange, because four diggers were jammed into each small living suite. With two eight-by-ten bedrooms feeding into a tiny sitting and kitchen area, and an even tinier bathroom, there was hardly anyplace to keep clothing, so they kept it in their bags.", "Elijah shared a room with a middle-aged volunteer from Ala\u00adbama named Steve Phelps. When Elijah\u2019s cell phone vibrated at two o\u2019clock, his first move was to roll up on one shoulder, turn it off, and listen to Phelps breathe.", "Phelps was a sound sleeper, and he was sound asleep now. Eli\u00adjah often got up to pee at night, and hadn\u2019t awakened anyone doing that for two weeks\u2014the days and the sun were exhausting, and once his roommates were familiar with his night moves, they never twitched.", "When he was sure of Phelps, Elijah rolled out of bed, mov\u00ading\u00a0as quietly as he could. He\u2019d loaded all of his personal items\u2014 wallet, passport, small cash\u2014into his pants the night before, so all he had to do now was get into them. His socks were already rolled into his shoes, which he would put on outside.", "When he was dressed, he listened again to Phelps, then eased through the door into the sitting area. Here was the tricky part. Another of the diggers, who slept in the adjoining room, had keys to one of the dig cars\u2014and the keys were sitting on a radiator in his room.", "Elijah stepped to the door of the other bedroom, and again, listened for a moment. Both of the men snored, which was why they\u2019d been put together. When he was sure that he could distin\u00adguish the separate snoring, he eased open the door (he\u2019d put a dab of Crisco on the hinges the night before, when the others were out) and stepped silently into the room.", "The men continued to snore, which helped cover his move\u00adment as he stepped barefooted across the room and picked up the car keys. Two seconds later, he was out of the room; a minute after that, he was outside with his bags, in the cool of the Israeli night, sitting on the steps, tying his shoes, and again, listening and watching.", "It had been an exciting day\u2014maybe somebody else had been restless?", "But nothing moved anywhere on the kibbutz as far as he could\u00a0tell. He\u2019d been through one tricky part, and now here was the second one. When his shoes were tied, he walked down to the\u00a0first floor with his bags\u2014a nylon backpack and a leather satchel\u2014and around behind the dormitory to a low wooden building used to sort and classify pottery and other finds at the\u00a0dig.", "There were no lights inside the building. He reached into his bag, took out a large screwdriver, and pried open the door. Inside, navigating without lights, he went to a row of metal lockers, felt for the fifth handle down, and with the same screwdriver, pried open the locker door.", "A stone sat on the locker shelf. He couldn\u2019t see it, much, but he could feel it, and it was heavy. He put it in his leather satchel, closed the locker door and the outer door.", "A half hour later, Elijah the Mankato-ite sped west in a stolen car past Jezreel, where, roughly 2,850 years earlier, Jezebel the queen had been thrown out a window. Her body had been eaten by dogs\u2014all except for the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet\u2014just as predicted by the other Elijah, the prophet guy.", "As they didn\u2019t say at the time, Bummer.", "The latter-day Elijah paid no attention to Jezreel, as the former royal city was now just another stony field. Ten minutes later, he rocketed past Armageddon\u2014Megiddo to the locals\u2014where there was no battle going on, penultimate or otherwise. At Megiddo, he\u00a0turned northwest toward Mount Carmel and the Mediterra\u00adnean coast at Haifa.", "Elijah was in a hurry: he had to be gone before the diggers got up, and some of them got up very early, at four o\u2019clock. He kept his foot on the floor, and the much-abused Avis rent-a-car groaned with pain. Out the passenger-side window, as he went past Megiddo, he could see the lights of Nazareth twinkling across the farm fields of the Jezreel Valley.", "It was pretty, all right, but he\u2019d been to Israel too often to be\u00a0impressed. He remembered that first naive astonishment, forty-five years earlier, when he found that the Mount of Ol\u00adives\u00a0was full of fake religious sites, that the Sea of Galilee was full\u00a0of Diet Coke bottles, and that Jesus\u2019 hometown was an Arab city where a good Christian could get his ass kicked if he wasn\u2019t careful.", "Not that he didn\u2019t love the place, because he did. He loved all of it, from the green and blue mountains in the north to the sere desert in the south, and especially the shephelah, the Judean low\u00adlands, and above all Jerusalem. But he loved it more like an Israeli than an American; that is, despite its faults.", "The flanks of Carmel were still dark when he drove into town. He\u2019d leave the Avis car outside the dealership, he\u2019d decided, where they\u2019d find it when they opened at eight o\u2019clock. He had a legiti\u00admate set of keys for the car, but it had been rented on a credit card provided by a credulous American graduate student from Penn State. The student would be mightily pissed if Elijah lost the car. In fact, he\u2019d be mightily pissed if Elijah left the car outside the Avis agency, but Elijah had more important things to worry about than the feelings of grad students.", "Luckily, the Avis agency wasn\u2019t far off Route 75, and not far from the harbor, either. He found it easily enough, dumped the car, left a message on the dashboard, and called a cab.", "As he waited, he fumbled a couple of pills from a bottle that he kept in the backpack, swallowed them without water.", "The cabdriver didn\u2019t speak much English, but Elijah had ex\u00adcellent Hebrew, so they got along. The cabdriver asked, \u201cOnly that luggage?\u201d", "Elijah had the nylon backpack and the leather duffel with brass buckles. \u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a day trip.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t go on the water,\u201d the cabdriver said over his shoulder. \u201cIf the water grows too deep in my shower, I get seasick.\u201d", "\u201cNever been a problem for me, though I live as far as you can get from an ocean,\u201d Elijah said.", "\u201cThis is in the States?\u201d", "\u201cYes, Minnesota,\u201d Elijah said.", "The driver noticed that his fare was sweating, even in the cool of the early morning. He also had the expensive leather bag clenched in his lap, as though it might contain an atomic bomb. The driver didn\u2019t ask.", "Strange things happened in Israel every day of the week, and asking could be dangerous. Though in this case, the driver thought, danger was unlikely: the man wore a black snap-brimmed hat, a white clerical collar under his black polyester suit, and he had an olive-wood cross hanging from a silver chain around his neck.", "He was a type. He would have been a type anywhere, but in Israel, he was really a type. Give a guy a black suit, a clerical collar, a wooden cross, and a sick, screaming baby, and he could walk through any checkpoint in Israel with his socks full of cocaine or C-4. Because he was an annoying, proselytizing, American Chris\u00adtian type\u2014the kind who usually came with slightly noxious reli\u00adgious and political opinions, and who was almost always chintzy with the tips.", "Though not in this case. The driver dropped Elijah at the Fish\u00aderman\u2019s Anchorage at HaKishon, the mouth of the Kishon River, and Elijah gave him a hundred-shekel note, which was way too much. He didn\u2019t ask for change, simply hustled away, the pack on his back and the leather bag clutched in his arms, like a sick baby.", "Elijah had been to the port four days earlier, where he\u2019d found the people he\u2019d been looking for: a German couple, drifting around the Med on an ancient fiberglass sailboat with an engine that worked some of the time. He\u2019d offered them five hundred dollars to transport him, without questions, across the water to the Old Port at Limassol on the Greek half of Cyprus.", "The Germans had been reduced to eating pilchards fished from the dirty port waters and cooked over an alcohol stove, so a little human smuggling wasn\u2019t really a central ethical problem for them. The woman, a lanky blonde named Gerta, told him that she could provide carnal entertainment during the trip for an\u00a0extra two hundred, but Elijah declined, citing conservative religious values.", "When Elijah arrived on the dock, the Germans were awake and waiting, perhaps nervous that their five hundred dollars had gone somewhere else.", "Gerta\u2019s partner, also lanky and blond, but improbably called Ricardo, pushed them off the dock within thirty seconds of his arrival. He fired up the engine, which coughed loudly before re\u00adsuming its silence. Ricardo whacked it a couple of times, and got it running well enough to get them out into open water, where the Germans launched the sails.", "Ricardo said, \u201cSuch a nice day for sailing. Should I put your bags below?\u201d", "\u201cNo, no, they make a place to sit,\u201d Elijah said, in German. His German, like his Hebrew, was excellent, and their English was no better than the cabdriver\u2019s, so it was what they had. He sat on his pack and clutched the leather bag in his lap.", "\u201cSo you are carrying your valuables there,\u201d Ricardo said, as Haifa slowly lowered itself on the horizon. He was eyeing Elijah\u2019s bag as a great white shark might examine a dog-paddling fat lady.", "\u201cYes, but I\u2019m afraid some of them will have to go over the side before we get to the Old Port,\u201d Elijah said.", "\u201cOver the side?\u201d Ricardo was puzzled.", "\u201cYes, over the side,\u201d Elijah said. He pulled an older-looking Be\u00adretta 92F from the bag, a gun that may have migrated from Iraq to Israel, looking for work. It fit well in Elijah\u2019s rugged hand, a hand that might have seen an early life throwing bales of hay onto a horse-drawn wagon. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, because it is a fine piece of weaponry. Fast, powerful, and accurate.\u201d", "The muzzle was not pointed at Ricardo, but neither was it\u00a0pointed far away. Ricardo, who\u2019d been sitting unnecessarily close\u00a0to the reverend\u2014for Elijah was indeed an ordained minister in the\u00a0Lutheran Church in America\u2014eased away. \u201cPerhaps not over the side,\u201d Ricardo said. \u201cWhen we get to the port, I could find a place to put it.\u201d", "Such a fine piece of weaponry would sell for a couple of thou\u00adsand dollars on the right stretch of the Med, Elijah thought, and come to no good end.", "\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Elijah said.", "AND PERHAPS NOT.", "The trip took all that day, the next night, and most of the fol\u00adlowing day. The winds were perfect: strong enough to give them a good run, but not so overwhelming that the seas got trashy. Elijah spent the time on deck, reading books on an iPad, wrapped in a nylon rain suit during the cool of the night. He\u2019d come prepared.", "When Cyprus hove in sight, and when Ricardo was preoccu\u00adpied with getting the engine started again, Elijah dropped the pistol over the side. As they came into the marina area, Ricardo, who\u2019d properly understood the display of the pistol as a counter to any possible ambitions concerning the reverend\u2019s valuables, asked about the gun.", "\u201cFell over the side,\u201d Elijah said. And, \u201cI think the man on the dock is trying to get your attention.\u201d", "Dockside, they told their story: Elijah Jones was an American who\u2019d joined his German friends for a sail in the Med, but who\u2019d unexpectedly begun urinating blood and was in great pain. Elijah explained that he was dying of colon cancer, and was making a last trip around the eastern Mediterranean to say good-bye to friends in Greece, Egypt, and Israel. Now he just wanted to get home to Mankato, Minnesota, so he could die in peace.", "He would need to stop at the local hospital, he said, and then go on his way. As proof of his condition, he showed the customs man his bag of medications and a treatment letter from his physi\u00adcian at the Mayo Clinic.", "He was also sweating and stifling groans, and as the customs officials conferred over his documents, he asked to be excused to the dockside, where he promptly peed blood into the Mediterra\u00adnean Sea. The chief customs agent stamped his passport and ex\u00adpressed the wish that God would bless him.", "Twenty minutes after they reached the port, Elijah was on his\u00a0way to Larnaca International; six hours later, on his way to Charles de Gaulle in Paris, and six hours after landing there, on his way to Minneapolis.", "At Minneapolis, two uniformed paramedics, one male and one female, were waiting in the customs area. Elijah, sweating like a boxcar loader, was pushed into the baggage area in a wheelchair. The customs guys asked him if he had anything to declare, he groaned, \u201cNo.\u201d A drug dog gave him a perfunctory sniff, and they waved him through to the EMS techs and the waiting ambulance.", "The male paramedic carried his bags, and joked, \u201cWhat you got in here, a rock?\u201d", "Ninety minutes after that, Elijah checked into the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, and told the techs to put his duffel bag on the floor by the bed.", "Three days later, when his condition had again been stabilized, and he was no longer peeing blood, he checked himself out.", "But he didn\u2019t tell anybody. He just walked.", "With the heavy leather bag.", "2", "It was one of the great Minnesota summers of all time\u2014or maybe it just felt that way, after one of the most miserable springs in history. On April 22, in a nasty little snowstorm, he\u2019d skidded off a highway in Apple Valley, and had had to call for a tow to get his four-wheel-drive truck out of the ditch.", "On May 1, he\u2019d gone north to a friend\u2019s cabin near Hayward, Wisconsin, to do some early-season fly-fishing for bluegills, and it had snowed the whole day, and the day after that, totaling sixteen inches of the stuff, and then it had spent two days raining old women and sticks, as the Welsh would say, although they\u2019d actu\u00adally say something more like mae hi\u2019n bwrw hen wragedd a ffyn.", "But the summer\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. ah, the summer, which was now coming to its peak, the summer was a joy to behold, even from the inside of a diner.", "Virgil Flowers was sitting sideways in a booth in a Perkins res\u00adtaurant on Highway 169 in Mankato, Minnesota, his cowboy boots hanging off the end of the seat. He was talking to Florence \u201cMa\u201d Nobles about her involvement in a counterfeit lumber ring, of which she denied any knowledge. He\u2019d been investigating her for a while, and had even met three of her five intra-ethnic father\u00adless boys\u2014Mateo, Tall Bear, and Moses.", "Virgil picked up a french fry and jabbed it at her: \u201cDave Moss said you sold the same barn fifteen times, Ma. He says your boy Rolf has another two thousand board-feet of lumber down at the bottom of the Minnesota River, getting old. Dave says you\u2019ll be peddling that all over New England next year.\u201d", "Ma made a rude noise with her lips, and Virgil said, \u201cC\u2019mon, Ma, that\u2019s not necessary.\u201d", "Ma said, \u201cThat goddamn Moss can kiss my ass\u2014though, to be honest, he already did that and seemed to like it all right. This is more a domestic dispute than anything else, Virgie. I broke it off with him, and he\u2019s just getting back at me.\u201d", "Virgil said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can believe that, Ma. There\u2019s a fel\u00adlow named Barry Spurgeon who spent forty-four thousand dol\u00adlars buying lumber from your boy, so he can build some sort of a barn-mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut. He got suspicious and did a tree-ring test and that tree was cut down last year. Last year, for Christ\u2019s sakes, Ma. You didn\u2019t even let it go five years. Spur\u00adgeon wants that money back because he paid for real old-timey barn lumber.\u201d", "His phone rang and he picked it up and looked at it: Lucas Davenport.", "\u201cI gotta take this,\u201d he said. He pushed the \u201canswer\u201d tab on the phone and said, \u201cHang on a minute, Lucas,\u201d and to Ma, \u201cYou sit right here. Do not run away.\u201d", "\u201cInstead of talking about barn lumber we oughta talk about how to scratch my itch,\u201d Ma said, pushing out her lower lip. \u201cHere it is July and I ain\u2019t been laid since March the eighteenth. You\u2019re just the boy to get \u2019er done, Virgie.\u201d", "Virgil slid out of the booth and walked back toward the men\u2019s room, where nobody was sitting. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked Davenport.", "\u201cGot an assignment for you\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. easy duty,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cAw, man. I left my shotgun at home.\u201d \u201cNo, no, nothing like that,\u201d Davenport said, though he\u2019d been", "known to lie about such things. \u201cThere\u2019s an Israeli investigator who needs to talk to a professor at Gustavus Adolphus, though the professor actually lives there in Mankato.

What\u2019s that about?\u201d", "Virgil was keeping an eye on Ma as he spoke to Davenport, and it wasn\u2019t particularly hard to do. She was undeniably a crimi\u00adnal redneck, but she was also a pretty blonde, only thirty-four, though she had five children, including a nineteen-year-old. She had a long, thick pigtail down her back, and a short, slender body. If, purely hypothetically, she were lying on a California king with that hair spread out over her\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.", "\u201c.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0some kind of precious artifact\u2014\u201d", "\u201cWhat?

He apparently left Israel illegally\u2014 the Israeli cops tracked him to a port and he caught a boat to Cy\u00adprus and then flew home from there.\u201d", "\u201cWhat kind of artifact?\u201d Virgil asked, now semi-interested. \u201cDoes it have mystical powers?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know about mystical powers, but supposedly it\u2019s a piece of a stele\u2014a steelee? I don\u2019t know how you pronounce it\u2014 that\u2019s got some ancient writing on it. The whole thing has appar\u00adently got the state of Israel in an uproar,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cAnyway, the Israelis want it back and the State Department says if Jones stole it and brought it into the country, he broke about nine laws. I\u2019ll send you a sheet on it.\u201d", "\u201cThat sounds like a federal case,\u201d Virgil said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t the Israelis talk to the FBI?\u201d", "\u201cWell, it is a federal case. The feds have issued a hold on Jones, based on information from the Israelis, and also because he said he had nothing to declare when he came through customs, which was a lie. The feds asked us in because of local knowledge\u2014that\u2019d be you\u2014and because we owe them one this month, and the boss okayed it,\u201d Davenport said.", "\u201cI bet the stone does have mystical powers,\u201d Virgil said. \u201cMaybe the Israelis can use it to blast Iran, or something.

Okay?\u201d", "Ma caught Virgil looking at her, and her tongue came out and stroked her upper lip. Just in case Virgil might have missed it, she did it again. Davenport said something else, but Virgil missed that, and he said, \u201cGoddamnit, I\u2019m up to my ass on this lumber thing. What time is she coming in?\u201d", "After a moment of silence, Davenport said, \u201cI just told you", "that: I don\u2019t know. Today, tomorrow, the next day.

He wound up spending the night at Johnson\u2019s cabin, where Johnson and his current girlfriend, Shirley, made a nice dinner out of baked walleye and fresh hand-picked watercress. Virgil and Johnson did a little northern fishing in the early morning, and then Virgil headed back home.", "At Rochester, he stopped at a McDonald\u2019s, got a Quarter Pounder with Cheese, declining the offer of a Double Quar\u00adter\u00a0Pounder, checked his e-mail on his iPad, and found a message from the Israeli: she\u2019d be arriving at Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul at one o\u2019clock. Virgil checked his watch and figured he\u2019d have enough time to cut cross-country to the Cabela\u2019s outdoor superstore at Owatonna on his way north.", "Virgil Flowers was a tall, thin man, two inches over six feet unless he was wearing cowboy boots, which he usually was, and then he was three and a half inches over six feet. He wore his blond hair long, curled over his ears and the back of his neck; in general, he looked like a decent third-baseman, which he\u2019d been in high school and for a while in college, until he found out he couldn\u2019t reliably hit a college-level fastball.", "After college, he did time in the army, expecting an assign\u00adment\u00a0in the infantry or intelligence. The army made him a cop, which, to his surprise, he liked. He was a captain when he got out, landed a job with the St. Paul cops, and a few years later, moved to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Now he was\u00a0the only resident agent in the southern end of the state. He would\u00a0work six or eight murders in the course of an average year, and spend the rest of his time chasing down people whose crim\u00adinal activities required more range than an individual sheriff \u2019s office could normally cover. Ma Nobles, for example, lived in one county, her son in another, a suspected accomplice in a third, and the lumber might well be hidden underwater, precisely on a county line.", "In addition to his cop duties, Virgil was an outdoor writer,", "though he\u2019d recently branched out and had stories printed in both the New York Times magazine and Vanity Fair.

I will be there as soon as I can.\u201d", "She was another twenty minutes. Virgil finished the bucktails story and was reading about Bulldawg technique when people began gathering around the carousel.

You must be Virgil?\u201d", "\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Virgil said, unfolding from the chair.", "They shook hands and she said, \u201cYael Aronov,\u201d and, \u201cI have two large bags.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Virgil said. \u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d", "\u201cAt the Mankato Downtown Inn?

She was pretty, but if Virgil had been asked what she looked like, he would have said, \u201cTough.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m tired. It was straight through\u2014Tel Aviv to Newark, and then a long layover in Newark and then to here,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to sleep.\u201d", "\u201cI was never told who you work for, exactly,\u201d Virgil said. \u201cI understand you\u2019re looking for an artifact of some kind.\u201d", "\u201cI work for the Israel Antiquities Authority, the IAA. I\u2019m an investigator\u2014really, the only investigator,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re look\u00ading for part of a stele\u201d\u2014she pronounced it stella\u2014\u201cthat was sto\u00adlen by this Reverend Jones.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what a stele is.\u201d", "\u201cOkay, I will tell you,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the ancient Middle East, the various kings, Persian, Egyptian, Assyrian, when they con\u00adquered a place, would sometimes put up a stone pillar boast\u00ading\u00a0about their conquest. They often inscribed the pillar with more than one language, usually their own and the local lan\u00adguage. Then, after they died, another conqueror would come along, and the old pillars would get thrown down and broken up, and maybe new pillars set up. What Reverend Jones found was a piece of one of these pillars, a piece of a stele. Unfortunately, he stole it, and carried it out of the country.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d", "\u201cOne hundred percent,\u201d she said.", "Jones, she said, had been working on Israeli digs since the late sixties, most recently at an excavation on the Jordan River east of\u00a0the town of Beth Shean. He was one of the most trusted diggers\u2014a man with long experience, decent Hebrew, and good friends all over Israel.", "Then, a little more than a week earlier, there\u2019d been a stunning find: a fragment of a black limestone stele, a little more than a foot long and about ten inches thick at the thickest part.", "She broke off to say, \u201cHere are my bags.\u201d", "They were, in fact, two of the largest suitcases Virgil had ever seen come off an airplane. But when he pulled them off the car\u00adousel, they were light, as though they were almost empty.", "\u201cThey weigh\u2014\u201d", "\u201cNothing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut believe me, they will weigh much more when I go home. I will put refrigerators in them, if I can.\u201d", "\u201cWhy is that?\u201d \u201cIsraeli taxes,\u201d she said. \u201cIsrael would tax words, if that were", "possible. Would tax air. This way\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. no taxes.\u201d \u201cAll right.\u201d", "They towed the two bags out to Virgil\u2019s truck and threw them in the back. Out of the airport, he said, \u201cSo, keep talking. The stele was a foot long and ten inches thick\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d", "\u201cYes. Everybody was jubilant, excited,\u201d she said. \u201cThe director of the dig, Rafi Frankel, this is the greatest find of his career. It came out late in the morning\u2014they stop digging at noon because of the heat. Reverend Jones was actually the one who found it. We have photos from the earliest moments, when all you could see was one dressed edge of the stone coming up through the\u00a0dirt.\u201d", "More photos were taken as the stone was dug out of the ground, she said, and as it was removed from the dig pit and care\u00adfully wiped. When it was out of the ground, it was driven back to a dig house, put on a table, where more photos were taken.", "\u201cFrankel is a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in the Institute of Archaeology,\u201d Yael said. \u201cHe called friends there and told them of the find, and of course, the word spread in\u00adstantly. He said he would transport it the next day to Jerusalem. Some of the people from the dig stayed up late, until ten o\u2019clock, examining the stone. Then it was secured in a locker, and the room was locked, and everybody went to bed. When they got up at four-thirty, the stone was gone. So was a car, and Reverend Jones.\u201d", "Frankel immediately called the Israeli cops, who eventually traced the Avis rent-a-car to the city of Haifa. There, they lost the trail for a couple of days, fooled by a false scent: the report of a\u00a0tall man in a dark hat and dark suit walking near the Avis dealer\u00adship with a couple of big bags. They tracked the man down, but he turned out to be an Orthodox Jew who lived in the neighbor\u00adhood, and had nothing to do either with the dig or with Jones.", "Backtracking, they eventually found a cabdriver who had taken Jones to the port. A yachtsman there told investigators about two Germans who had vanished with their boat that same morning that Jones disappeared. The Germans were identified by customs, and four days later, they were found in the Old Port of Cyprus.", "The Germans said they\u2019d taken the American for a sail, but he\u2019d become seriously ill, had begun vomiting and urinating blood. They\u2019d dropped him at the Old Port, they said, as the fast\u00adest place they could get to, and had last seen Jones getting into a taxicab.", "\u201cWe didn\u2019t believe all of that, of course. We think they were paid to take him out of the country. But, mmm, it was a hard story to break because a Cyprus customs official actually wit\u00adnessed Reverend Jones urinating blood,\u201d Yael said. \u201cWhen we continued to trace his travels, we found that he came here, and was taken to the Mayo Clinic. He has terminal cancer. After three days, he left the clinic, without permission, and his whereabouts are now unknown.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you have reason to believe that he had the stone with him,\u201d Virgil said.", "\u201cOh, yes. He was carrying a large leather bag, which he would allow nobody to touch. The cabdriver said he carried it like", "a\u00a0baby.\u201d \u201cWhat could he do with it?\u201d Virgil asked. \u201cIf you have all those", "photos, he couldn\u2019t sell it.\u201d", "\u201cAh. But he could,\u201d she said. \u201cFor a lot of money, if he made just the right connection. Perhaps he saw it and went a little crazy. He\u2019s dying\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. maybe he thought this would be a big thing, if he could publish it himself.\u201d", "\u201cYou know what\u2019s on the stone? What it says?\u201d", "\u201cNo, no, that will take some study,\u201d Yael said. \u201cOne side is in Egyptian hieroglyphics and the other, perhaps some primitive form of Hebrew. Nobody really knows for sure,\u201d she said. She yawned, and then said, \u201cMaybe I sleep for a few minutes. This day catches up to me.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s a pillow right behind your seat,\u201d Virgil said.", "\u201cThank you. This is excellent,\u201d she said, as she fished the pil\u00adlow out of the back and then snuggled against the passenger-side window. \u201cI sleep now.\u201d", "And she did, as Virgil drove along, thinking about the story she\u2019d told. The story interested him for two reasons: he\u2019d grown up as a minister\u2019s son, and Bible tales had been a big part of his youth. The other thing was, she\u2019d told the truth right up to the end, and then she\u2019d begun lying. She was good at it, but Virgil had been lis\u00adtening to liars for years, and he could hear the lies in her voice.", "There was something about the stele that she didn\u2019t want him\u00a0to know\u2014or that she didn\u2019t want to talk about. He wondered why. Mystical powers? Hmm. He drove on.", "3", "Virgil dropped Yael at her hotel. She was still dazed from the jet lag, she said, so he led her inside, got her checked in, agreed to pick her up for breakfast the next morning, and sent her up to her room.", "He lived a mile away, and decided he might as well get going on the Jones case: with any luck, he could have it settled by the time he picked Yael up in the morning. There wasn\u2019t much of the working day left, but Gustavus Adolphus College was only fifteen minutes away, and Jones lived even closer.", "At home, he cut up an apple and moved to his den, where he got online with the college. Jones was listed as a professor emeri\u00adtus in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology. His online vita said that he\u2019d graduated from a seminary in St. Paul and had been ordained there, and later graduated from the University of Iowa with a Ph.D. in early and primitive religions.", "When he\u2019d been working full-time, he\u2019d taught Archaeology of the Holy Land, the History of Religion and the Hebrew Bible.", "He\u2019d worked on archaeological digs in Israel, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece during the late sixties and the seven\u00adties, and after becoming a tenured professor at Gustavus, had led annual student treks to Israeli archaeological digs.", "Attached to the site was a note that he was leading a dig that", "summer, with the dig scheduled to start on Sunday, June 23, and", "continue for six weeks.", "Judging from the dates of graduation listed in his vita, Jones must have been in his late sixties. His departmental photo showed a thick\u2014but not obese\u2014bearded man dressed in a short-sleeved blue shirt and long khaki pants and boots, standing with a group of smiling students both male and female, on the edge of a dig, with odd-looking black tents in the background. On closer exami\u00adnation, the tents appeared to be swaths of some kind of fabric held up with PVC drainage pipes.", "As with Yael, if asked to describe Jones, Virgil would have in\u00adcluded the word \u201csmart.\u201d Jones looked like a smart, tough, prairie", "preacher, Virgil thought, and he\u2019d met a number of those.", "With Jones\u2019s background in mind, Virgil went online with the Department of Motor Vehicles and took a look at his driver\u2019s li\u00adcense. While the online photo at the college had shown a man with jet-black hair and a thick black beard, the license photo showed a thinner man with graying hair and beard, though both were more black than white; but it was the same guy, and he lived only eight blocks from Virgil.", "Virgil thought, Pick him up tonight, wring him out, get the rock back, give it to Yael in the morning, and send her on her way. Warn Jones about not running, and let justice take its course. Whatever that might be. With any luck, he could be back investigating Ma Nobles by noon the next day.", "Ma, he thought, was a much more interesting case. With that thought, he shut down the computer, put the remains of the apple in the garbage disposal, washed it away, and headed over to Jones\u2019s house.", "Jones lived in a plain-vanilla clapboard house that had a porch with a wooden swing and a picture window that looked out over the porch steps to his small front lawn. A flower box hung under the window, but had no flowers in it; a big but barren flowerpot sat on the porch at the top of the steps.", "The front door had a wide, short window that was covered with two curtains, with a crack between them; he peered through the crack and simultaneously rang the doorbell. Nothing moved. He rang again, and there was none of the vibration you got from an occupied house.", "After a third ring, and another minute on the porch, he walked over to the detached garage and looked in the window: there was an SUV inside, but it appeared to be covered with a thin layer of dust, as though it hadn\u2019t been moved for a few weeks. Had Jones been home at all? He\u2019d certainly had the time.", "After looking in the garage window, he wandered into the backyard and looked in a window in the back door, but couldn\u2019t see anything but the inside of a mudroom, with a bunch of coats hanging on pegs.", "He\u2019d climbed down off the stoop when a woman shouted, \u201cHello?\u201d He looked around and saw her next door, standing on her own back stoop, an old lady with a cane and Coke-bottle glasses, looking at him with suspicion.", "He called back, \u201cI\u2019m a police officer. I\u2019m with the state Bureau", "of Criminal Apprehension.\u201d \u201cElijah isn\u2019t home. He\u2019s in Israel,\u201d she called.

Or did she go with him?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s Magda, poor thing. She has Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d the old lady said. \u201cShe\u2019s in a home now. He couldn\u2019t take care of her anymore. No, he lives here by himself. His children are gone. One lives up in\u00a0the Cities, one is out on the West Coast, San Diego, I think.

Ellen works for the state, her last name is Case. You could probably find her that way. Did something bad happen?\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s some kind of an argument going on with this dig that Reverend Jones was on,\u201d Virgil said, evading the question. \u201cLis\u00adten, I\u2019m going to leave a note on his front door. If you should see him, tell him to call me, right away. The moment he gets in.\u201d", "When Virgil left Jones\u2019s house, he checked his watch. If Gus\u00adtavus Adolphus operated like most colleges, he might be too late to talk to anyone, but he wasn\u2019t doing anything else anyway, so he decided to take fifteen minutes to run up to the town of St. Peter, where the college was.", "Gustavus was a mixture of old and new buildings set on a rolling campus; in the late nineties, it had been hit by a huge F3 tornado that tore the campus apart, but luckily during spring break, and none of the students were killed.", "Virgil had to poke around for a few minutes before he found the administration offices, and from there was sent to Jones\u2019s de\u00adpartment, where he found a woman pecking at a computer key\u00adboard in a small book-stuffed office. Her name was Maicy, she said, an assistant professor. She\u2019d been working every day, she\u00a0said, because she couldn\u2019t afford to go anywhere that summer, and had not seen or heard from Jones.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of calls, though,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t been able to help. We can\u2019t even believe what they\u2019re telling us\u2014 that Elijah stole this stele? I mean, if so many people weren\u2019t tell\u00ading us the same story, I would have said it was nonsense. I don\u2019t think Elijah ever stole a single thing in his entire life. To steal a stele? It\u2019s hardly credible.\u201d", "She was insistent, and said that if Virgil tracked down other department members, he\u2019d get the same thing from them: until they saw the proof, they would not believe that Jones was in any", "way involved in any theft.", "Virgil thanked her and left.", "He\u2019d run out of time. The college offices were closing, and there wouldn\u2019t be much more that night. He stopped by Jones\u2019s house again, found his note still on the door, leaned on the bell, got nothing.", "It occurred to him that Jones might be inside, dead. If another day passed with no sight of the man, he\u2019d go talk to a judge about that idea\u2014or call the daughter, when he found her.", "Virgil went home, ate, and resumed work on a magazine story about fly-fishing for carp, the part about stalking tailing carp in shallow water.", "Yael was bright and cheerful and drinking coffee when Virgil arrived at the hotel\u2019s restaurant at eight o\u2019clock the next morning. He slid into the booth across from her, and she said, \u201cI am com\u00adpletely screwed. I slept well until one o\u2019clock this morning and then I woke up. I haven\u2019t been back to sleep since. About four o\u2019clock this afternoon, I am going to die.\u201d", "Virgil said, \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll be done by four. I couldn\u2019t find him last night, I looked, but he only lives about a half-mile from here. We\u2019ll check his house again, and if we don\u2019t find him, we\u2019ll check\u00a0with his daughter and see if she knows where he is.

I mean this place he stole it from\u2014is it in a town, or out in the countryside, or what?\u201d", "\u201cOut in the countryside, east of the city of Beth Shean, very close to the Jordan River.\u201d", "\u201cOkay. Now, Jones has a Ph.D. from an actual legitimate uni\u00adversity, so he\u2019s probably not stupid. If he\u2019d stolen the stele and then reburied it, say, a few hundred yards away, who would have known? He could have pretended to be as mystified as everyone else. When it was time for him to leave, he could dig up the stone, pack it in his luggage, get a boat out of town. Who\u2019s to know?\u201d", "\u201cBut he didn\u2019t do that,\u201d she said. \u201cI told you what he did.\u201d", "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Virgil said. \u201cI mean, look at it. He finds the stone, digs it up, steals it, steals a car, drives it to the car agency, where it can be traced instantly\u2014he could have left it in a parking lot somewhere, and you might still be looking for it.", "Then, dressed as an American Christian minister in a big black suit with a white collar, who speaks good Hebrew, he calls a taxi and overtips the driver. Then he gets a ride out of the coun\u00adtry\u00a0with these Germans, who everybody in the marina knows. He then pees blood into the harbor in Cyprus, so that everybody will be sure to remember him there, and flies home, where he\u2019s met by an ambulance crew.

Get the steelee and send Yale home.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I went over to talk to Jones this morning, but he wasn\u2019t there, but a burglar was, and I think there\u2019s blood on the floor.\u201d", "\u201cAhhhh\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. shit.\u201d", "\u201cYeah. But it might not be from violence. He\u2019s got cancer, and\u00a0he\u2019s apparently been leaking a lot of blood.\u201d Virgil told him about the runner, and about the smear, and about how Yael was lying about something, and then he asked, \u201cDo you have any hint what this stele might involve? I mean, it looks like Yael\u2019s not the only one who wants it. And wants it bad enough to break into a\u00a0house.\u201d", "\u201cNo idea,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cBut if there\u2019s blood, and a bur\u00adglary, then put the screws to this chick.

If this is gonna be another fuckin\u2019 Flowers circus, I don\u2019t want the details.\u201d", "Davenport occasionally had some good ideas, Virgil\u00a0thought, as he rang off. Like calling people from the dig. It should be late afternoon in Israel, so if he could call soon\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.", "He dug his iPad out of the pocket of the passenger-side seat-back. He signed on, went to the Gustavus Adolphus website, got the names of the other faculty in Jones\u2019s department, and the main number for the school. After hassling a bit with a function\u00adary in the school\u2019s office, he got home phone numbers for four other faculty members. He struck out on the first one\u2014no answer\u2014but the second one, Patricia Carlson, picked up on the first ring. Virgil identified himself, and asked her what she knew about the dig, or anyone else on it.", "\u201cHang on a minute,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to go online here.\u201d", "A minute later, she said, \u201cThere are seven Gustavus students at the dig, and one parent. I have the emergency cell phone number for the parent, in Israel. Her name is Annabelle Johnson.\u201d", "The miracles of modern communication, Virgil thought. He\u2019d gone online from a computer in his truck, which coughed up phone numbers for a college faculty in a different town, and from there, had gotten a phone number for a woman half a world away.", "Earlier that year, he\u2019d been fishing at a fly-in camp in north\u00adwest Ontario, fifty miles from the nearest road, and another guy, whose wife was pregnant, and whose father was seriously ill, had a sat phone, and had daily conversations with them both, routed through his personal satellite link.", "Annabelle Johnson was in a dormitory at an Israeli kibbutz. She\u2019d been taking her afternoon nap when Virgil called. He ex\u00adplained the problem, and she said, in a hushed voice, \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to talk about it. We\u2019re shocked, here. Shocked when Eli\u00adjah ran away.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m working with an investigator from Israel,\u201d Virgil said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure she\u2019s being entirely up front with me. I could really use some help.\u201d", "He told Johnson about the encounter at Jones\u2019s house and about the smear on the floor. \u201cI can\u2019t find Reverend Jones, and that worries me\u2014especially if that smear turns out to be blood. Can you tell me if Jones was behaving differently on this trip? I know he\u2019s sick\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s dying,\u201d Johnson said.", "\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told,\u201d Virgil said. \u201cEven given that, how was he behaving? Was there anything unusual about him, in the days before he found the stele?\u201d", "\u201cListen, this dig is really rough work. It\u2019s like excavating a base\u00adment using nothing but trowels, in a hundred-and-four-degree heat. People feel bad all the time. There\u2019s always somebody who\u2019s dehydrated, who can\u2019t make it out in the morning. So it\u2019s hard to tell when something unusual is going on,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cElijah was sick, and sometimes he didn\u2019t make it out. But he tried, every day. I was so happy when the stele came up\u2014I was right in the next square, and when he found that first edge, it was like, \u2018Okay, this could be amazing.\u2019 But we\u2019ll find something that could be amazing several times every dig, and they usually turn out to be\u00a0disappointments. But this\u2014this was even more amazing than anything we\u2019d ever expected.\u201d", "\u201cWhy would he run away with it?\u201d Virgil asked. \u201cHe\u2019d have to", "know that everybody would be on his trail. What could he ac\u00adcomplish?\u201d", "Johnson said, \u201cI think he saw what was on the stele and he freaked out. Something just broke. All the stress from the dig, from the heat, from the cancer, from worrying about his wife\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and then this. I think he snapped.\u201d", "Virgil: \u201cThe Israeli investigator here said it\u2019d be quite a while", "before they knew what was on the stele. You mean\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. he already knew?\u201d", "\u201cOh, God,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019re really not supposed to talk about that. Too many people already know. There are all kinds of photographs. Even some of the kids have photographs, although they\u2019re supposed to have turned them over to the Israelis. It\u2019s bound to get out.\u201d", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Virgil said. \u201cIs it really a big deal?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah.

Thriller Award\u2013winner Sandford ventures into Da Vinci Code territory in his clever, quirky seventh Virgil Flowers novel (after 2012's Mad River). When an archeological dig in Israel turns up a stele\u2014an inscribed piece of stone\u2014with the potential to shake the roots of Biblical faith, Elijah Jones, a college professor who fears he's dying, steals the precious artifact and flees home to Mankuto, Minn. Virgil, a Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Investigation agent, at first simply attempts to recover the stolen object, but soon finds himself trying to outwit mercenary Turks as well as agents of the Mossad, Hezbollah, and Texas gazillionares, all of whom want the artifact for their own purposes. Despite the bloodthirsty fanaticism the participants display, the quest for the stone provides many opportunities for cross-cultural verbal confusion and violent slapstick. Though attracted to a sexy local criminal who's become Jones's accomplice, the exasperated Virgil mainly tries to stop the commotion before anyone gets seriously hurt. Unusually good-natured intrigue distinguishes this outing. Agent: Esther Newberg, ICM.

An evening with Virgil Flowers seemed just the ticket to escape the stresses of my everyday life.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this installment doesn't hold up as well as the rest of the Virgil Flowers series.  More farce than novel sometimes-- who's got the stone? He's got the stone, no she's got the stone, oh look he's coming in the front door while someone else is going out the back door-- it struck me more like a movie treatment that got stretched to book length rather than a carefully planned novel. Maybe this book wasn't as carefully edited as the rest of the series, or perhaps there was some assistance by an unnamed writer, but it didn't flow well and felt choppy in places.<br /><br />There's some one-line humor, and action, and a moral/ethical dilemma or two, but I liked Virgil better in previous books when he was dealing with more realistic situations and characters more true to southern Minnesota than to Hollywood (former governors notwithstanding). Frankly, this book could have been set anywhere; there's not much Minnesota in it, and the reason I read regional mysteries is for their sense of place.  The \"villain\", if one can call him that, isn't very well developed, and I simply didn't buy that the character would behave as he did; it didn't sit right.  The women characters are even less well developed than usual, unless you're speaking of breast development, which gets old as it is nearly the only subject of repartee about one of the main female characters.<br /><br />It's an okay escapist read as long as you don't set your expectations too high.

He's also dying of cancer and about to leave behind him a wife with Alzheimer's who may wind up living for years with minimal care. Then one day, Jones's team uncovers an ancient stele--a stone with inscriptions carved into it. A preliminary examination suggests that the information on the stele, if accurate, could require a significant reinterpretation of the Bible and could also radically undermine some long-held religious beliefs.<br /><br />While the rest of the team sleeps, Jones smuggles the stone out of the camp and makes his way back to Mankato, Minnesota. The theft causes an uproar and the Israeli government sends an attractive female antiquities expert to help American authorities recover the stone.<br /><br />The American authorities in question would be that F****ing Virgil Flowers of the Minnesota BCI. Virgil is hip deep in an investigation involving fraudulent antique lumber and his prime suspect is a very sexy woman named &#34;Ma&#34; Nobles. When Virgil's boss, Lucas Davenport, pulls him off the case and tells him to pick up the Israeli expert and recover the artifact, he's not at all pleased, but figures it should be a fairly easy and simple assignment.<br /><br />Wrong again, Virgil.<br /><br />The case immediately takes a lot of unexpected twists and turns, and tracking down either the Reverend Jones or the stele is hardly a piece of cake. Things are complicated because, as word of the discovery spreads, an awful lot of other people both foreign and domestic are anxious to get their hands on the stele. Virgil just wants to recover the damned thing and return it to its rightful owners before anyone gets killed so that he can get back to Ma Nobles and the Case of the Fraudulent Lumber. But that may be easier said than done.<br /><br />As always, it's great fun to spend time in the company of Virgil Flowers, and this is a pretty entertaining book. To my mind, though, it's not up to the standards set by the earlier Virgil books. The plot is way way out in Dan Brown land and is so implausible that a reader, or at least this one, simply can't suspend disbelief enough to really get into the book. I never for a moment bought into the plot, but I did laugh a lot as Virgil investigated the case as only he can.

His Prey series has been my favorite; I eagerly awaited each new release. Unfortunately, some of his later works have not been favorites, and with Storm Front, Sandford\u2019s latest, the author has hit an all time low. If I hadn\u2019t been a long-time fan, I\u2019d never have finished the book.<br />  Since The DaVinci Code became a blockbusting success, everyone\u2019s writing books about an ancient relic that if made public, would change the world of religion, as we know it. For me, most of them are nothing but 400 page chase scenes. Not my personal taste, but they have become extremely popular.<br />  Who could imagine Sandford fitting this type of storyline into a Virgil Flowers novel! Storm Front stars Virgil Flowers, a character who, like Lucas Davenport before Sandford married him off, is a super-sleuth, and super-successful womanizer. The story opens when Flowers is assigned a case involving an ancient inscribed stone, whose message, if shared with the world, would create chaos in the middle east. The man who stole the stone from a dig in Israel is from Minnesota and is known to have returned to the US with it. Flowers is assigned the case, begins looking for the man, finds the thief missing (of course!) and within a matter of days, he encounters at least four factions (all armed and dangerous) that are also in pursuit of the stone, which is estimated to be worth millions of dollars.<br />  Now, despite the theme of the book, the story does captivate the reader. Flowers is an interesting character, and I did enjoy his investigation and interplay with the people seeking the stone. About halfway through, however, something happened, that if I weren\u2019t a devoted Sandford fan, I would have quit reading the book.<br />  When Flowers finally gets the stone in his possession, did he find a vault to put it in? A bank? A police station? A Brinks truck? People have been shot at, nearly killed, assassins are part of the chase, (not to mention, once more, the thing is worth millions), and Flowers takes it home with him and stores it in his dishwasher. The reader is expected to believe this character, solver of all crimes, would be that stupid. It\u2019s no surprise to the reader that the stone is stolen during the night.<br />  After that I had a hard time forcing myself to finish reading the book, but I finally made it through, extremely disappointed with the story.", "images": [], "asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "parent_asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "user_id": "AGKSQ3ZJRBYIOQIFKCFHRDSA4ZKQ", "timestamp": "2013-12-03 15:15:34", "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 4, "title": "Love That Freaken Flowers!", "text": "Flowers.

When STORM FRONT began, he was in Israel and had just found a stele.  The stele, about 2000 years old, had writing in both hieroglyphics and an ancient Hebrew.  Both told the story of a battle.  In one, King Solomon was the hero.  In the other, an Egyptian pharaoh, Siamun, was.  Sandford stated:  \"David was not a rich and powerful king.  He ran a small kingdom.\" where most of the people were \"rural and poor.\"  \"Solomon suddenly has enormous riches, a huge treasury...and the Queen of Sheba comes to sleep with him.\"  \"The insignificant kingdom had always been under the thumb of the Egyptians.\"  If the stele is true, the Pharoh Siamun was Solomon.  It would completely change the history of Israel, raising questions about who its early settlers were and whether today's Jews had a right to live their based on their historical ties. Sneaking out at night, he stole a car, took a cab, hired a boat, and made his way to Cyprus and back home to Minnesota, leaving a very obvious trail including some blood stains.  He also took the stele with him.<br /> Elijah Jones was dying of cancer and had only weeks to live.  For a reason that is explained about halfway in the book, he decided he needed a lot of money and thought selling the stele would be an easy way to get it.<br /> He was wrong.  The Israeli government wants the stele returned, preferably before the information about it is publicized.  Hezbollah wants it to support their claims against Israel.  A Texan wants as part of his quest to find legendary antiquities and publicize himself.  So Jones, who goes into hiding (when he is not hospitalized and snuck out of the hospital) decides to auction it off for $3,000,000.<br /> Virgil Flowers, a lawman from a small town in Minnesota, had as his biggest concern stopping one of the residents from selling fake old wood when he was charged with finding the stele.  The task became very complicated as Jones and the stele keep disappearing, the potential buyers attempt to get it by any means possible, and a character's identity is stolen.  He finally doesn't believe what anyone says but does his best to get to the truth and capture the stele.<br /> One conversation I found interesting was between Flowers and an Israeli:\"Do you believe the Bible?\"  \"Some parts of the histories, yes.

As another reviewer wrote, \"where is the stone, who has the stone, where is Jones, does he have the stone...\".  Importantly, there is no sense of menace to drive the plot along.  One doesn't feel strongly against Jones, nor strongly for him.  As in other Flowers books, he winds up having sex with a witness to the crimes he is investigating, which is always bizarre.  That seems to be a requirement for each book along with the appearance of at least one \"dishwater blonde\".  I found quite a bit of humor in the dialogue, but overall the book drags along - too many scenes that go nowhere as characters fumble around, show up, disappear and show up again.<br /><br />One serious complaint I have echoes that of another reviewer.  I find the Israeli women trying to find bargains at Sam's Club and Best Buy bordering on stereotypical anti-Semitic cliches that are best edited out.  They are the (offensive) equivalent of having an African character slurping up watermelon.  In previous books by the author I was surprise to see some strongly anti-gay statements.  I could do without this kind of thing in the thrillers that I choose to read.  Unnecessary at best, offensive at worst.  It doesn't matter to me when he wrote it.  Racist stereotypes aren't amusing.<br /><br />And then the constant harping on the size of a character's breasts, at least three times in the book.<br /><br />\"She had no trouble floating, Virgil thought, probably because she had built-in water wings.\"<br /><br />Puerile, juvenile objectification.

A lot of stereotyping of foreign characters, and after a few dozen times you get tired of bungled American idioms by them.  I kept hoping the end was coming but then the book jumped the shark.<br /><br />Without giving much away, I'll just say that Flowers carelessly mishandled evidence.  He even had his two buddies Shrake and Jenkins available to help secure it, but he sends them home.  He tells Davenport he's got the evidence, and instead of telling him to bring it in right away, Davenport just congratulates him and hangs up.

Probably not, so it was insulting to me as a reader to be subject to it, to keep the book going.<br /><br />I read a couple more chapters, then just skimmed a few pages and then skipped around at barely glanced at pages I landed on until the end.

To me, this book seems more like a parody of a John Sandford novel, than an actual John Sandford novel.  The book is full of caricatures rather than characters, and there aren't any homicides to solve.  (I prefer a novel with a lower violence level than, e.g., the Jack Reacher books - one or two murders per novel are plenty for me.  But the plot of this one just felt like the stakes were too low to be very interesting.  I'm not a fan of \"religious mystery\" plots.)<br /><br />I heard Sandford's interview on NPR several months ago, in which he said that other writers would be involved in drafting \"Sandford\" books from now on, to enable more per year to be published.  This is the first new book by \"Sandford\" I have read since hearing that interview, and I have to say, I think the quality of the writing has suffered.  I hope Sandford and his collaborator(s) get better at the new system of turning out \"Sandford\" novels, so I can enjoy future ones as well as I did the earlier ones.

I'd hate to think that Sandford has joined the James Patterson Club(you know, putting one's name on books he really didn't write?), but perhaps he has.  This book certainly didn't read like a Sandford novel.  As I was reading it, something felt. . .off, as if maybe an impostor had written it.<br /><br />Like most fans, I anticipate new releases from my favorite authors, so when Stormfront came out, I promptly fired up my Kindle and bought it.  When I found out that the story was going to involve some ancient religious artifact, I was like, \"oh oh.\"  These kinds of stories never seem to grab me, but I was thinking that since it is Sandford, and since Flowers is the main character, somehow he would make this compelling, so I began reading.<br /><br />Got to page 50. Not gripped yet.<br />Got to page 100. Nope, still not into it.<br />Halfway through the book(\"Okay, is thing gonna ever pick up?\").<br /><br />You get the point.<br /><br />What you have is  a story about a dying archaeologist who found an artifact while at a dig site in Israel.  He fled the site and returned to the States with the artifact. Turns out this artifact could very well rewrite history for the Israelis in a bad way, so they want it. . .and so do other people in the book for various reasons, people ranging from a rogue Mossad agent, to some hot southern belle who wants to jump Virgil's bones.  Flowers gets pulled into the situation regarding finding and recovering the artifact and giving it back to Israel.  The thief is looking to sell to the highest bidder.  A lot of meandering and bungled attempts to get it back from this elusive, dying thief  occur.  If it's any comfort, no one in this book dies(wait, doesn't Virgil usually deal with murders?)<br /><br />Now,does this sound like something Sandford would even come up with?  Anyway, the book reads like a bad dark comedy, and Virgil comes across as an unwilling participant in the whole thing.  It's all very eye-rolling, and none of the characters in the book, good or bad are likable.  This is not the Sandford I know.  This read like some underling attempting to write like Sandford.  Like parody, even.<br /><br />The book was only around 380 pages, but felt like 500+ because is was SO flat, dull, and uninspired.

Which could mean death for anyone, and everyone foolish enough to find themselves involved.<br /><br />Virgil Flowers, is an agent with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. He is pretty much the only agent responsible for the southern half of the state. His boss Lucas Davenport tasks Virgil to pick up an incoming specialist from the Israel Antiquities Authority, Yael Aronov, who is coming to the states in search of the missing artifact. What is being called the Solomon Stone. A stone that could rewrite the histories of two very large religions. And if this stone is the real thing, it could be worth millions to the right buyer.<br /><br />When Virgil meets Yael, something just doesn't sit right with him. She seems hard, just not right to him. And as it turns out, Virgil's instincts are never wrong. Now he not only has the missing stone to find. He needs to find out what Yael is hiding from him.

Was it a bad book? No.  Was it a bad story? No. Was it poorly written? Not in my opinion. But what it wasn't was a typical John Sandford novel. There was no murder to solve, no mystery to solve. Just a big game of Hide And Seek. The winner gets the stone. A lot of boots on the ground investigative work. Which made the book really drag in spots. There was a point about 3/4 of the way through the book where everything is starting to wrap up, that it felt like the story was going to pick up.

That's why I am so incredibly impressed with what John Sandford has accomplished over the past 30+ years.<br />  In 1980, Sandford (aka John Camp) became a daily columnist for The Saint Paul Pioneer Press, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing five years later.  His debut novel was released in 1989.  To date, he's written two dozen novels featuring detective Lucas Davenport.  I'm not sure when Virgil Flowers first appeared, but he became a protagonist with the 2007 release of Dark of the Moon.  Seven more Flowers novels followed, and the Lucas Davenport Prey series is still going strong.  The books are as fresh and exciting as ever, and that's the case regardless of which series you choose to read.  I could continue to sing John Sandford's praises all day but this is supposed to be a book review so let's get to it.<br />  In Storm Front, Virgil Flowers is given the presumably simple task of retrieving an ancient relic and returning it to its rightful owner.  The man currently holding the relic smuggled it out of Israel.  He's also old, so sick he's peeing blood, and clearly on the verge of death.  Virgil has little trouble tracking him down.  Getting his hands on the ancient relic proves to be far more difficult.  Standing in his way are an assortment of middle eastern cops, would be terrorists and other crazies, some American opportunists and fortune hunters, and a horny woman who makes a living selling bogus antique wood.  Everyone is lying to him and no one seems to realize how dangerous of a game they're playing.<br />  Storm Front is proof that John Sandford is still at the top of his game.  He is a true master of the mystery/thriller genre.  Like so many previous Sandford novels, Storm Front is cleverly crafted, well written, and the story is told with the style and ease of the consummate pro.

Now that they're appearing in the same books - in this, the seventh Flowers installment - Davenport is the boss of Flowers, a Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension agent, and the two interact fairly often. It is the more colorful Flowers, though, who is my favorite of the two - probably because he's more laid back, somewhat along the lines of Raylan Givens of the hit TV show &#34;Justified.&#34;<br /><br />Here, Flowers has been assigned to track down the one-time preacher and university professor who apparently has stolen a valuable artifact from a dig in Israel, smuggling it home to Minnesota. As the search for the man and the artifact ensues, Flowers goes head to head with bad guys and gals who believe it to be authentic and are desperate to get it for a variety of reasons (mercenary Turks, Mossad, Hezbollah and even a U.S. millionaire or two).<br /><br />The plot is a bit reminiscent of a Dan Brown novel, but other than that, there's not much of a comparison. I don't recall chuckling even once when reading any of Brown's books (think &#60;The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons), but Flowers never fails to amuse with witty comments and insights. One of my favorites this time out happened when Flowers was having dinner at Applebee's, a popular chain restaurant, where he'd ordered ribs (which, IMHO, are delicious). When he looked over at a couple of other diners who were chowing down shrimp platters, which he'd &#34;considered and rejected, feeling that Red Lobster would have given him a better quality seafood entree.&#34;<br /><br />I do agree with other reviewers, however, that this probably isn't the best book to start with for those who want to get acquainted with the Virgil Flowers series (in fact, some insist Sandford had a co-writer who penned much of it). It moves along quickly, but the story borders on the unlikely and Flowers barely escapes acting and sounding like a buffoon in spots. While it's a fun read that held my attention all the way to the end, it's not Sandford's best.", "images": [], "asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "parent_asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "user_id": "AH6FH3BG2EAOF7NYAIIW3JIUKUYQ", "timestamp": "2013-11-25 15:05:39", "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 4, "title": "There's a storm brewing . . .", "text": "Virgil at his best.

I've been a fan of Sandford for a long time, pretty much read them all, and really enjoyed the segue to the Virgil Flowers books. This one's different, and it just plain isn't very good. There's no suspense, dialogue by rote, cardboard characters, lots of inconsistencies, holes in the plot, dumb mistakes in geography, the list goes on. It's as though somebody sat down and thought, well, here's an idea -- an artifact from Israel makes it way to Minnesota. Then we can throw in Israelis, Mossad, Hezbollah, and more uninteresting people than I've ever seen in a Sandford novel. (The \"love\" interest is named \"Ma\". Really? Come on.)  Can't really write interesting dialogue? That's OK, cause we'll just go back and lift most of it from previous Virgil novels and change it up to fit the current plot. Mostly, except for the original stuff which doesn't work at all.<br />If Sandford is planning to make himself into the next cottage book producing industry like James Patterson has, with his awful novels, he's on the right path. Unfortunately, it's not a path I will be walking down anymore, and that makes me kind of sad. I've really enjoyed the journey, but I'm not buying any more tickets.

Why not: Sandford has been 1 of my favorite authors, and I've really enjoyed both Davenport and Flowers over the years.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you the story...that's Sandford's job and besides I don't want to ruin things for any potential readers out there.  But putting it simply, this book was absolute drivel.  The story line itself was inane, the characters (sadly, including even Virgil himself in this installment) shallow, and the overall plot and conclusion simply didn't make any sense.<br /><br />Are you getting the sense I didn't like this book...if so, you're very perceptive.  Sorry, but I feel one of the masters of this genre has either lost it, or just doesn't give a spit anymore.  C'mon, this book is an insult to our intelligence as well as his, assuming Sandford really wrote it.  And Dan Brown has nothing to worry about....Sandford is really out of his element writing about ancient artifacts and the like.<br /><br />If you're new to Sandford/Davenport/Flowers save your money and time.  Read the early Prey books, especially those with Carla Rinker, and by all means read the first 3 or 4 Flowers novels, but stay away from this very unsatisfying effort.<br /><br />One last point....and I really do NOT want to pre-judge.  Along with this book, I also ordered Sandford's  &#34;Field of Prey,&#34; a new (to me) Davenport installment.  I was looking forward to reading it, and likely still will.  But given the last couple of Flowers novels as well as the 2 Davenport books prior to &#34;Field&#34; I have to say my expectations are low.  Given the great work Sandford has put out over the years I find that kind of sad.", "images": [], "asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "parent_asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "user_id": "AGMNWHJMHUCFAMJGGWSPSXEW7G2A", "timestamp": "2015-04-30 11:43:28", "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 4, "title": "Four Stars", "text": "I liked it.", "images": [], "asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "parent_asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "user_id": "AFBAW7GQJZYHA3NZVXHJOQIVO4UQ", "timestamp": "2014-07-24 14:30:20", "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 4, "title": "as usual a good sandford book", "text": "I enjoy john sandford books , I especially like the character virgil flowers.  little bit different venue , and a couple of twists. would recommend it.", "images": [], "asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "parent_asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "user_id": "AGDOR2KMHZW7PAOUE436CYPQ7POQ", "timestamp": "2013-11-22 15:57:00", "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5, "title": "Five Stars", "text": "great entertainment", "images": [], "asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "parent_asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "user_id": "AHEUTIYAVLL22PTTI63UYDYZDQUA", "timestamp": "2014-07-08 12:56:15", "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5, "title": "As always", "text": "Sandford does well as always!

Good and Bad luck occur in life, but I like good old fashion hard work and good thinking on the part of an investigator and you always get those with Sanford.

The Sandford team does a good job differentiating Virgil Flowers from Lucas Davenport so I enjoy reading them in alteration.<br /><br />The plot of this is a smidge different than some of the other Flowers (let alone the harder Davenport) books. Not a lot of violence and murder but that also fits Virgil's character. And yes, it takes a turn into Da Vinci territory a bit but personally I thought that was kind of fun: the idea of Mossad agents, murdering Turks, Hezbollah terrorists, Hollywood types, and the like all running around Minnesota of all places was sort of amusing and certainly a different context than we usually encounter such characters. In way, almost perversely so, to have all those folks in one place and yet the story resolves without murder at every step.<br /><br />I say kudos for writing an interesting mystery -- how will things turn out? is the artifact real or not? -- without resorting to the usual cliches.", "images": [], "asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "parent_asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "user_id": "AHXT7UKRKWEPBFY4ML3BLT6OJKNQ", "timestamp": "2013-10-12 04:51:06", "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5, "title": "Five Stars", "text": "Enjoyed the read", "images": [], "asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "parent_asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "user_id": "AGJAVLYXZ4ASURFXGJANSISDBHWA", "timestamp": "2016-05-19 22:25:08", "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 1, "title": "Not Sandford's best...", "text": "A banal novel about a Detective's helper - Flowers.

The story of a purloined archeological treasure that could be used to rewrite history is quite compelling.<br /><br />The chase to track down the \"Solomon Stone\" races back and forth over Minnesota and involves an international cast of characters...you get Mossad, Israeli archaelogists, Hezbollah, Turks, academicians on the make, reality tv stars, with the help of wannabe pilots and local criminals and hustlers-at least of few of which will likely make appearances in future books.  The action moves along at a good clip, Lucas Davenport has cameo telephone appearances, and the BCA hard ass squad comes in to provide backup.<br /><br />There are some of the usual Sandford tactics-like the situation resolving itself, and then spinning back out of control.  The author is-as always-very good at juggling a large cast of characters, and has the skill-maybe the literary gift-of writing in such a way that as he pushes you toward one scene/action, you forget about a character...and when that character pops back up it is a surprise.<br /><br />If you have never read a Sandford/Virgil Flowers book, you will enjoy it.  If you have followed the series, you will enjoy it.  A good read that I heartily recommend.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Because it is missing a certain something.  This is in a way the most vanilla of the Flowers novels.  If you doubt me, read the book and calculate the body count.  There is far more slight of hand and skullduggery working here than in most Sandford novels, and that makes the book drag at points.  Also, there is a feeling of the generic to the background.  There is little of Minnesota in this.  Beyond a few local yokel type names for bars and such (\"Custard's Last Stand\"), there is little of the local color that make both the Davenport and the Flowers novels so interesting.  The things that make Virgil tick-going to crime scenes towing his boat, working on an article or thinking item x could make a good article, new references to his background, his ruminations on philosophy-not here.<br /><br />This story could have taken place in Alaska, Bolivia, Manhattan, Amsterdam, Boston, Nokesville, VA...anyplace.  There is nothing really Minnesota to it...and as someone who enjoys the local color Sandford normally brings to the table, that is enough to bump this otherwise highly entertaining book from five stars to four.<br /><br />SPOILER: Chapter 23 might be the finest and most succinct chapter the author has ever penned.", "images": [], "asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "parent_asin": "B00C5R7I9C", "user_id": "AERPQKROUGZID2LZV2RYMQ6YIWTQ", "timestamp": "2013-10-09 11:45:02", "helpful_vote": 25, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 5, "title": "\"A1\" writer who spins a great yarn.", "text": "Virgil Flowers is a perfect character for John Sandford\u2019s story; it was such a good story told by a great story teller.
